Taste Trove
Description: : In the restaurant industry, gathering meaningful feedback from customers is challenging. Traditional methods like comment cards or online surveys are often overlooked or fail to capture detailed feedback beyond basic ratings. We propose a mobile app designed to streamline the feedback process for restaurants. This app includes a standard survey for general feedback on food quality and service. Additionally, it features a unique "Monodish" section where customers can suggest new dish ideas or combinations they'd like to see on the menu.
